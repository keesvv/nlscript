# About
NLScript is a scripting language that uses Dutch grammar for its syntax, which makes it quite unique. It's meant to be an interpreted and dynamically typed language, but things may change in the future.

NLScript is built to have a very straightforward syntax. Even if you don't speak Dutch, it's still fun to learn a couple of Dutch words along the way.

This project is still in a very early stage of development, but more modules, instructions, examples and documentation are going to be added very soon.
